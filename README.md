This web application is designed to present and document the projects and exercises I have completed. 
The site includes:

A personal introduction where I describe my skills, interests, and what I enjoy most about development (frontend, backend, databases, etc.).
A project showcase featuring the different tasks I have completed, with descriptions and screenshots of both the code and the results.
Clickable project links so visitors can explore each project in more detail.
The site is built using Vue.js, with extra effort put into the styling and UI design to make it visually appealing.
